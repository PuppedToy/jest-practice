# Instructions

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`
3. Create the methods `isValidPassword` and `getPasswordSecurity` to make all tests pass when `npm test`.
4. Uncomment `__tests__/cleanText` and create the requested tests. Find errors and fix them to make all tests pass. When you are finished, check the expected errors you should have fixed in `errors.txt`
